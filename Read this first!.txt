If you're using any of the NES versions of the scripts, default or sleek, before running it, you MUST open the file and set the 'game' variable to either the game you're playing or the game the ROMhack you're playing is based off of in order to have both accurate warp zone remainders and the framerule counter to be accurate. For example, if you're playing Super Bob, that game is based off of NTSC SMB, so you would set the 'game' variable to '"NTSC SMB"'. Pellsson ROM is automatically detected and is prioritized over all the other four games, so if you're using Pellsson, it doesn't matter what you have the 'game' variable set to. If you set the 'game' variable to a non-valid value, this will cause you to not have accurate warp zone remainders, and it will make the framerule counter default to you not playing on PAL SMB. The 'game' variable is set to '"NTSC SMB"' by default.

I will not implement a framerule counter for the All-Stars versions of the scripts because I don't know how I'll be able to. Unless you're using Pellsson, the framerule counter only works with the following routes:
- Start → Small → End
- Start → Small → Mushroom → End
- Start → Small → Mushroom → Fire → End

If you using any of the NES sleek version of the scripts, set the video resolution to 256×240p. Here's how to do it for each emulator:
BizHawk: NES → Graphics Settings. Under "Drawing Area", set "First Line:" and "Last Line:" to '0' and '239' respectively. (For NTSC, you can click the "Full [0,239]" button as a shortcut. For PAL, you have to manually input the numbers.)
FCEUX: Config → Video. Under "Drawing Area", set "First Line:" and "Last Line:" to '0' and '239' respectively.
Mesen 2: Settings → NES → Video → NTSC/PAL. Set both "Top" and "Bottom" to '0'.
Mesen and MesenRTA: Options → Video → Overscan. Set both "Top" and "Bottom" to '0'.
